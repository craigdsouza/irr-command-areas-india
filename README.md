# Mapping Irrigation Command Areas

This is a repository, aimed mainly at digitizing boundaries of command areas of major and medium irrigation projects using the Water Resources Information System (WRIS), web map service as reference. This would be vital to know and monitor the performance of irrigation projects each cropping season.

# How-to

This idea is still in a nascent stage. To contribute you can pull the latest version of the boundaries (geojson format) and edit them in QGIS or any other GIS software. You will need to use the WRIS WMS as reference for digitization.
